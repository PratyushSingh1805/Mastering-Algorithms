# Mastering Algorithms (ACA IITK)

This repository contains C++ implementations of assignment problems from the **Mastering Algorithms** project conducted under the **Association of Computing Activities (ACA), IIT Kanpur**.

The project aimed to strengthen algorithmic problem-solving skills through a structured, week-by-week exploration of core data structures and algorithms, competitive programming patterns, and mathematical foundations.
